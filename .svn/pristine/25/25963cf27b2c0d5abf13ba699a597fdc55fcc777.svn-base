Assign3: Due 11:59PM November 6

The Factorial of a number is the product of all numbers in the range 1 to the number.

Write three implementations of a function to compute the Factorial of a number.

Please start with one implementation at a time rather than rushing through all of them at the same time.

The implementations are described below:

1. An imperative iteration. 
  Given a number, loop through using traditional for.

2. A simple recursion.
  
3. A functional iteration. 
	  Use functional internal iterators to perform the operation.

Once you complete coding, please answer the following:

1. What design principles did you use in this assignment? Discuss.

2. What design patterns did you use? List each one of them, discuss what this pattern is, and give example(s) of where specifically you used it in this assignment.

3. Any surprises or things that you did not expect?
