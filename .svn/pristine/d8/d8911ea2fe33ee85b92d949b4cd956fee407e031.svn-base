synopsis:  let's change direction

details: 

From the previous review to this one, you have changed direction significantly. You were heading in the right direction before, but this new direction does not look like a good one. Let's change.

Let's change direction. We're getting dragged into processing time without first getting into the context of the application.

Let's step back and think about the design.

We take a list of lat and lon, it does not matter where the list comes from.
For each location (lat, lon) we want to get the time for the flyover. We don't 
have to worry right now about how to get that information, it can come from 
anywhere, that does not matter. Given a list of locations, we want to get a 
list of times. Let's call this function get_list_of_times_for_locations.

-get_list_of_times_for_locations for an empty list of locations returns an empty list.
-get_list_of_times_for_locations for a list with one location returns time for that location.

We are not interested right now to go out and get the actual time. 
get_list_of_times_for_locations can call another function that can eventually 
do the work. Let's keep our focus only on get_list_of_times_for_locations. How 
can we design get_list_of_times_for_locations so that it can use another 
function that will do the actual work of taking one location and returning the 
time?
