x canary test
x take in a single coordinate and return time London: 51.5074, -0.118092
x take in a single coordinate and return time Houston: 29.7604, -95.3698
- taken in a coordinate and timestamp then return local time
- give a list of Location return a list of local time
- take in an invalid entry of coordinate and return empty/error

Instead of the above, let's start with these:
x canary test
-get_list_of_times_for_locations for an empty list of locations returns an empty list.
-get_list_of_times_for_locations for a list with one location returns time for that location.
