x a live cell at 5, 5, and returns the 8 neighbors (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6) ...
x a live cell at 4, 4, and returns the 8 neighbors (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4) ...
x a live cell at 3, 3, and returns the 8 neighbors (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5) ...
x a live cell at a border, example (0, 0) and out put the neighbors (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (0, -1) ...
x given a live cell at position 2, 3, it generates eight signals for positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
x given a live cell at position 3, 3, it generates eight signals for positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
x given a live cell at positions 2, 4 it generates eight signals for positions (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
x given a live cell at position 0, 0 it generates eight signals for positions (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)
x given no position, generateSignalsForMultiplePositions returns an empty list
x given one position, generateSignalsForMultiplePositions returns eight positions
x given two positions, generateSignalsForMultiplePositions returns sixteen positions
x given three positions, generateSignalsForMultiplePositions returns twenty four positions

- given no positions, count_signals returns an empty Map
- given one positions, count_signals returns a Map with that position as key and value 1
- given two of the same positions, count_signals returns a Map with that positions as key and value 2
- given three positions, first and the third being the same, count_signals returns a Map with two keys. The value for one is 1 and the value for the other is 2
- given no positions, next_generation returns an empty list
- given one position, next_generation returns an empty list
- given positions (2, 3) and (2, 4), next_generation returns an empty list
- given positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 0), next_generation returns a list with one position (2, 1)
- given positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2), next_generation returns a list with positions (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
